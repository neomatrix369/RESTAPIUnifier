searches using the twitter API - should the twitter API be implemented or can it be a mock as well?
- mock first then replace with library (test first)
  - <done>, revisit (library and better tests) - see bottom

The results should be queryable, in English, and filtered according to whether the query 
term appears embedded in a word, in a hashtag, within the tweet text, in the username.
- mock - test first
   - test for term found in tweet message (body)
   - test for term found in hastag
   - test for term in username 
- <done>, see bottom

- use Class with the above fields - later refactor to something else

store in a flatfile
- mock - test first 

TODO
 - replace all assertTrue with assertThat construct overall
 - remove duplications in implementations and test code (including data) - no literals hanging around!
 - add negative tests (use triagulations)
 - ensure asserts have verbose messages
