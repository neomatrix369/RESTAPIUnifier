APIUnifier
==========

APIUnifier - lightweight Java library that brings together all the APIs of various formats under one roof! Eventually making such libraries available for different programming enviornments like Javascript, PHP, Python, etc...

Examples implemented using APIUnifier
-------------------------------------
MuzuTV API (search, browse, etc...) - https://github.com/neomatrix369/APIUnifier/tree/master/java/src/examples/GoogleTVHackathon

Timeline
--------
* 21 April 2012: discovery and inception of idea at a hackathon
*      May 2012: came across Mashery I/O Wraps Client Library Generator (see below)
*   August 2012: continued improving library at hackathon
* 23 April 2013: came across Import.IO (see below)
* 24 April 2013: further improvements to library - refactoring, tests, tidying up, etc...

Ideas based on similar principles
---------------------------------
* Import.IO - imports and reformats data using APIs from other sites/providers: http://Import.IO 
* Mashery I/O Wraps Client Library Generator - 
Native language client library (SDK) builder for platforms using I/O Docs: https://github.com/mashery/io-wraps/

- ...comment, suggest design improvements, take the idea to the next level.
- ...combine it with other interesting ideas, libraries, etc...
- ...do the above and submit pull requests.
- ...create new examples of existing APIs which can be accessed through the library.
